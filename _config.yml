# The directory for category index pages. Change it to something else if
# for example you want links like /categories/category1 instead of /category1
category_dir: /

# Uncomment if you are planning to run the blog in a subdirectory
# Note - if you enable this, and attempt to view your site locally you have to use the baseurl in your local path.
# Example, you must use http://localhost:4000/path/to/blog
# baseurl: /path/to/blog
baseurl: /juice # for github pages, uncomment this line, and recomment for local dev env

collections:

    output: true
    permalink: /my-collection/:path/
    # That way, _my-collection/item.md is outputted as my-collection/item/index.html when the site is built and would be accessable as example.com/my-collection/item/. The other advantage, is, because the data is now structured and machine readable (rather than in plain text), you could also use the jsonify filter to output that same information as an API for use elsewhere.
